EPUB Output Test Suite
======================

The DocBook-XSL EPUB output is backed by an extensive automated test suite. It
includes regression tests (epub_regressions_spec.rb), feature tests
(epub_spec.rb), a test of "real" book-length content (epub_realbook_spec.rb),
and a huge set of "smoke" tests, which check that *every* document in the
DocBook test document repository can create a valid EPUB (currently at 90%+
success).

Anyone considering developing, refactoring, or enhancing the EPUB output should
run these tests before submitted changes to SVN. The test suite may also help
improve bug reports.

The tests were written in Ruby using RSpec.


Prerequisites
-------------

The EPUB test suite requires the following software be installed and in your
PATH (or equivalent for Windows):

* xsltproc
* ruby 1.8+
* rspec (version=~1.1) http://rspec.info
* zip
* java
* epubcheck (1.0.5+) http://code.google.com/p/epubcheck/
  Note: a standalone epubcheck command is just a shell script or .bat as:

  epubcheck (Linux/Mac), chmod 775'd:
    #!/bin/sh
    java -jar /path/to/epubcheck-1.0.5.jar $@ # Linux/Mac

  epubcheck.bar (Windows):
    java -jar "/path/to/epubcheck-1.0.5.jar" %1 


Environment
-----------

Before running the test suite you must check out (all of) 
https://docbook.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docbook/trunk/ and set the
environment variable DOCBOOK_SVN to the location of the checkout.


Running tests
-------------

    $ cd epub/bin
    $ spec spec/epub_spec.rb 
    # ditto with the other *_spec.rb

Or, prettier:

    $ cd epub/bin
    $ spec --format specdoc --color spec/epub_spec.rb 


The tests verbosity can be increased by seting $DEBUG to true (near the top of
each spec file)


Windows notes
-------------

Installing xsltproc can be trying. Please refer to http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/InstallingAProcessor.html.

The other dependencies should be (relatively) straightforward.

You may have to "Unblock" the .dll and .jar files you downloaded in the File Properties (System) on some versions.
