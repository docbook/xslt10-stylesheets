<line remap="LINE">In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,</line>
<line remap="LINE">The inward service of the mind and soul</line>

<line remap="LINE">And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch</line>
<line remap="LINE">The virtue of his will: but you must fear,</line>
<line remap="LINE">His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;</line>
<line remap="LINE">For he himself is subject to his birth:</line>
<line remap="LINE">He may not, as unvalued persons do,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Carve for himself; for on his choice depends</line>
<line remap="LINE">The safety and health of this whole state;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And therefore must his choice be circumscribed</line>
<line remap="LINE">Unto the voice and yielding of that body</line>
<line remap="LINE">Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,</line>
<line remap="LINE">It fits your wisdom so far to believe it</line>
<line remap="LINE">As he in his particular act and place</line>
<line remap="LINE">May give his saying deed; which is no further</line>

<line remap="LINE">If with too credent ear you list his songs,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open</line>
<line remap="LINE">To his unmaster'd importunity.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,</line>
