<line remap="LINE">O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:</line>
<line remap="LINE">The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.</line>
<line remap="LINE">The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Retiring from the siege of Orleans,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.</line>
<line remap="LINE">By three and twenty thousand of the French</line>
<line remap="LINE">Was round encompassed and set upon.</line>
<line remap="LINE">No leisure had he to enrank his men;</line>
<line remap="LINE">He wanted pikes to set before his archers;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges</line>
<line remap="LINE">They pitched in the ground confusedly,</line>
<line remap="LINE">To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</line>
<line remap="LINE">More than three hours the fight continued;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Where valiant Talbot above human thought</line>
<line remap="LINE">Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:</line>
<line remap="LINE">The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;</line>
<line remap="LINE">All the whole army stood agazed on him:</line>
<line remap="LINE">His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit</line>
<line remap="LINE">A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain</line>
<line remap="LINE">And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,</line>
<line remap="LINE">If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:</line>
<line remap="LINE">He, being in the vaward, placed behind</line>
<line remap="LINE">With purpose to relieve and follow them,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Enclosed were they with their enemies:</line>
<line remap="LINE">A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Whom all France with their chief assembled strength</line>
<line remap="LINE">Durst not presume to look once in the face.</line>
