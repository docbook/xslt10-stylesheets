<line remap="LINE">Troop in the throngs of military men;</line>

<line remap="LINE">To diet rank minds sick of happiness</line>
<line remap="LINE">And purge the obstructions which begin to stop</line>
<line remap="LINE">Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.</line>
<line remap="LINE">I have in equal balance justly weigh'd</line>
<line remap="LINE">What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And find our griefs heavier than our offences.</line>
<line remap="LINE">We see which way the stream of time doth run,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And are enforced from our most quiet there</line>
<line remap="LINE">By the rough torrent of occasion;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And have the summary of all our griefs,</line>
<line remap="LINE">When time shall serve, to show in articles;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And might by no suit gain our audience:</line>
<line remap="LINE">When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,</line>
<line remap="LINE">We are denied access unto his person</line>
<line remap="LINE">Even by those men that most have done us wrong.</line>
<line remap="LINE">The dangers of the days but newly gone,</line>

<line remap="LINE">marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools</line>
<line remap="LINE">and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for</line>
<line remap="LINE">inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold</line>

<line remap="LINE">First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech.</line>
<line remap="LINE">My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;</line>
<line remap="LINE">and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look</line>
<line remap="LINE">for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have</line>
<line remap="LINE">to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I</line>
<line remap="LINE">should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.</line>
<line remap="LINE">But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it</line>
<line remap="LINE">known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here</line>
<line remap="LINE">in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your</line>
<line remap="LINE">patience for it and to promise you a better. I</line>
<line remap="LINE">meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an</line>
<line remap="LINE">ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and</line>
<line remap="LINE">you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you</line>
<line remap="LINE">I would be and here I commit my body to your</line>
<line remap="LINE">mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,</line>
<line remap="LINE">as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.</line>
<line remap="LINE">If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will</line>
<line remap="LINE">you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but</line>
<line remap="LINE">light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a</line>
<line remap="LINE">good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,</line>
<line remap="LINE">and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have</line>
<line remap="LINE">forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the</line>
<line remap="LINE">gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which</line>
<line remap="LINE">was never seen before in such an assembly.</line>
<line remap="LINE">One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too</line>
<line remap="LINE">much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will</line>
<line remap="LINE">continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make</line>
<line remap="LINE">you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for</line>
<line remap="LINE">any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,</line>
<line remap="LINE">unless already a' be killed with your hard</line>
<line remap="LINE">opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is</line>
<line remap="LINE">not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are</line>
<line remap="LINE">too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down</line>
<line remap="LINE">before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.</line>
