<line remap="LINE">In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece</line>
<line remap="LINE">The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Fraught with the ministers and instruments</line>
<line remap="LINE">Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore</line>
<line remap="LINE">Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay</line>
<line remap="LINE">Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made</line>
<line remap="LINE">To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures</line>
<line remap="LINE">The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,</line>
<line remap="LINE">With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.</line>
<line remap="LINE">To Tenedos they come;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge</line>
<line remap="LINE">Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains</line>
<line remap="LINE">The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch</line>
<line remap="LINE">Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And Antenorides, with massy staples</line>
<line remap="LINE">And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Sperr up the sons of Troy.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,</line>
<line remap="LINE">On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come</line>
<line remap="LINE">A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence</line>
<line remap="LINE">Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited</line>
<line remap="LINE">In like conditions as our argument,</line>
<line remap="LINE">To tell you, fair beholders, that our play</line>
<line remap="LINE">Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Beginning in the middle, starting thence away</line>
<line remap="LINE">To what may be digested in a play.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.</line>

<line remap="LINE">The specialty of rule hath been neglected:</line>
