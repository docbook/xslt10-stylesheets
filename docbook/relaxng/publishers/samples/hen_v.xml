<line remap="LINE">Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,</line>

<line remap="LINE">To this imperial throne. There is no bar</line>
<line remap="LINE">To make against your highness' claim to France</line>
<line remap="LINE">But this, which they produce from Pharamond,</line>
<line remap="LINE">'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'</line>
<line remap="LINE">'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'</line>
<line remap="LINE">Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze</line>
<line remap="LINE">To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</line>
<line remap="LINE">The founder of this law and female bar.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</line>
<line remap="LINE">That the land Salique is in Germany,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,</line>
<line remap="LINE">There left behind and settled certain French;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Who, holding in disdain the German women</line>
<line remap="LINE">For some dishonest manners of their life,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female</line>
<line remap="LINE">Should be inheritrix in Salique land:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Then doth it well appear that Salique law</line>
<line remap="LINE">Was not devised for the realm of France:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Nor did the French possess the Salique land</line>
<line remap="LINE">Until four hundred one and twenty years</line>
<line remap="LINE">After defunction of King Pharamond,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Idly supposed the founder of this law;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Who died within the year of our redemption</line>
<line remap="LINE">Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</line>
<line remap="LINE">Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French</line>
<line remap="LINE">Beyond the river Sala, in the year</line>
<line remap="LINE">Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</line>
<line remap="LINE">King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Did, as heir general, being descended</line>
<line remap="LINE">Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Make claim and title to the crown of France.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown</line>
<line remap="LINE">Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</line>
<line remap="LINE">Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</line>
<line remap="LINE">To find his title with some shows of truth,</line>
<line remap="LINE">'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</line>
<line remap="LINE">To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son</line>
<line remap="LINE">Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</line>
<line remap="LINE">That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:</line>
<line remap="LINE">By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</line>
<line remap="LINE">Was re-united to the crown of France.</line>
<line remap="LINE">So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.</line>
<line remap="LINE">King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,</line>
<line remap="LINE">King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</line>
<line remap="LINE">To hold in right and title of the female:</line>
<line remap="LINE">So do the kings of France unto this day;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law</line>
<line remap="LINE">To bar your highness claiming from the female,</line>

<line remap="LINE">As young as I am, I have observed these three</line>

<line remap="LINE">three, though they would serve me, could not be man</line>
<line remap="LINE">to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to</line>
<line remap="LINE">a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and</line>
<line remap="LINE">red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but</line>
<line remap="LINE">fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue</line>
<line remap="LINE">and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks</line>
<line remap="LINE">words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath</line>
<line remap="LINE">heard that men of few words are the best men; and</line>
<line remap="LINE">therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'</line>
<line remap="LINE">should be thought a coward: but his few bad words</line>
<line remap="LINE">are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never</line>
<line remap="LINE">broke any man's head but his own, and that was</line>
<line remap="LINE">against a post when he was drunk. They will steal</line>
<line remap="LINE">any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a</line>
<line remap="LINE">lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for</line>
<line remap="LINE">three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn</line>
<line remap="LINE">brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a</line>
<line remap="LINE">fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the</line>
<line remap="LINE">men would carry coals. They would have me as</line>
<line remap="LINE">familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their</line>
<line remap="LINE">handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,</line>
<line remap="LINE">if I should take from another's pocket to put into</line>
<line remap="LINE">mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I</line>
<line remap="LINE">must leave them, and seek some better service:</line>
<line remap="LINE">their villany goes against my weak stomach, and</line>

<line remap="LINE">So, if a son that is by his father sent about</line>

<line remap="LINE">imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a</line>
<line remap="LINE">servant, under his master's command transporting a</line>
<line remap="LINE">sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in</line>
<line remap="LINE">many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the</line>
<line remap="LINE">business of the master the author of the servant's</line>
<line remap="LINE">damnation: but this is not so: the king is not</line>
<line remap="LINE">bound to answer the particular endings of his</line>
<line remap="LINE">soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of</line>
<line remap="LINE">his servant; for they purpose not their death, when</line>
<line remap="LINE">they purpose their services. Besides, there is no</line>
<line remap="LINE">king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to</line>
<line remap="LINE">the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all</line>
<line remap="LINE">unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them</line>
<line remap="LINE">the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;</line>
<line remap="LINE">some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of</line>
<line remap="LINE">perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that</line>
<line remap="LINE">have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with</line>
<line remap="LINE">pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have</line>
<line remap="LINE">defeated the law and outrun native punishment,</line>
<line remap="LINE">though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to</line>
<line remap="LINE">fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;</line>
<line remap="LINE">so that here men are punished for before-breach of</line>
<line remap="LINE">the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where</line>
<line remap="LINE">they feared the death, they have borne life away;</line>
<line remap="LINE">and where they would be safe, they perish: then if</line>
<line remap="LINE">they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of</line>
<line remap="LINE">their damnation than he was before guilty of those</line>
<line remap="LINE">impieties for the which they are now visited. Every</line>
<line remap="LINE">subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's</line>
<line remap="LINE">soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in</line>
<line remap="LINE">the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every</line>
<line remap="LINE">mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death</line>
<line remap="LINE">is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was</line>

<line remap="LINE">have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable</line>
<line remap="LINE">measure in strength. If I could win a lady at</line>
<line remap="LINE">leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my</line>
<line remap="LINE">armour on my back, under the correction of bragging</line>
<line remap="LINE">be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse</line>

<line remap="LINE">eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;</line>
<line remap="LINE">only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,</line>
<line remap="LINE">nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a</line>

<line remap="LINE">uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee</line>
<line remap="LINE">right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other</line>
<line remap="LINE">places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that</line>
<line remap="LINE">can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do</line>
<line remap="LINE">always reason themselves out again. What! a</line>
<line remap="LINE">speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A</line>
<line remap="LINE">good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a</line>
<line remap="LINE">black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow</line>
<line remap="LINE">bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax</line>
<line remap="LINE">hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the</line>
<line remap="LINE">moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it</line>
<line remap="LINE">shines bright and never changes, but keeps his</line>
<line remap="LINE">course truly. If thou would have such a one, take</line>
<line remap="LINE">me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,</line>
