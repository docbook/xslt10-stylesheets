<line remap="LINE">Things base and vile, folding no quantity,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Love can transpose to form and dignity:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:</line>
<line remap="LINE">And therefore is Love said to be a child,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.</line>
<line remap="LINE">As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,</line>
<line remap="LINE">So the boy Love is perjured every where:</line>
<line remap="LINE">For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,</line>
<line remap="LINE">He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,</line>
<line remap="LINE">So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.</line>
<line remap="LINE">I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Then to the wood will he to-morrow night</line>
<line remap="LINE">Pursue her; and for this intelligence</line>
<line remap="LINE">If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:</line>
<line remap="LINE">But herein mean I to enrich my pain,</line>
<line remap="LINE">To have his sight thither and back again.</line>
