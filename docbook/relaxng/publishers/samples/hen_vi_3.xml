<line remap="LINE">Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And now, to add more measure to your woes,</line>
<line remap="LINE">I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.</line>
<line remap="LINE">After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Were brought me of your loss and his depart.</line>
<line remap="LINE">I, then in London keeper of the king,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And very well appointed, as I thought,</line>
<line remap="LINE">March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Bearing the king in my behalf along;</line>
<line remap="LINE">For by my scouts I was advertised</line>
<line remap="LINE">That she was coming with a full intent</line>
<line remap="LINE">To dash our late decree in parliament</line>
<line remap="LINE">Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met</line>
<line remap="LINE">Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:</line>
<line remap="LINE">But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,</line>
<line remap="LINE">That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or whether 'twas report of her success;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Who thunders to his captives blood and death,</line>
<line remap="LINE">I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Their weapons like to lightning came and went;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or like an idle thresher with a flail,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.</line>
<line remap="LINE">I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,</line>
<line remap="LINE">With promise of high pay and great rewards:</line>
<line remap="LINE">But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And we in them no hope to win the day;</line>
<line remap="LINE">So that we fled; the king unto the queen;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,</line>
<line remap="LINE">In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:</line>
