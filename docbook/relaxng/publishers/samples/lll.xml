<line remap="LINE">That is, to live and study here three years.</line>
<line remap="LINE">But there are other strict observances;</line>
<line remap="LINE">As, not to see a woman in that term,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Which I hope well is not enrolled there;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And one day in a week to touch no food</line>
<line remap="LINE">And but one meal on every day beside,</line>
<line remap="LINE">The which I hope is not enrolled there;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And not be seen to wink of all the day--</line>
<line remap="LINE">When I was wont to think no harm all night</line>
<line remap="LINE">And make a dark night too of half the day--</line>
<line remap="LINE">Which I hope well is not enrolled there:</line>
<line remap="LINE">O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!</line>

<speaker remap="SPEAKER">BIRON</speaker>
<line remap="LINE">By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.</line>
<line remap="LINE">What is the end of study? let me know.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue remap="SPEECH"><linegroup>
<speaker remap="SPEAKER">FERDINAND</speaker>

<line remap="LINE">Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?</line>

<dialogue remap="SPEECH"><linegroup>
<speaker remap="SPEAKER">FERDINAND</speaker>

</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue remap="SPEECH"><linegroup>
<speaker remap="SPEAKER">BIRON</speaker>
<line remap="LINE">Come on, then; I will swear to study so,</line>
<line remap="LINE">To know the thing I am forbid to know:</line>
<line remap="LINE">As thus,--to study where I well may dine,</line>
<line remap="LINE">When I to feast expressly am forbid;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or study where to meet some mistress fine,</line>
<line remap="LINE">When mistresses from common sense are hid;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Study to break it and not break my troth.</line>
<line remap="LINE">If study's gain be thus and this be so,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Study knows that which yet it doth not know:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue remap="SPEECH"><linegroup>
<speaker remap="SPEAKER">FERDINAND</speaker>
<line remap="LINE">These be the stops that hinder study quite</line>
<line remap="LINE">And train our intellects to vain delight.</line>
</linegroup></dialogue>

<dialogue remap="SPEECH"><linegroup>
<speaker remap="SPEAKER">BIRON</speaker>
<line remap="LINE">Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:</line>
<line remap="LINE">As, painfully to pore upon a book</line>
<line remap="LINE">To seek the light of truth; while truth the while</line>
<line remap="LINE">Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:</line>
<line remap="LINE">So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Study me how to please the eye indeed</line>
<line remap="LINE">By fixing it upon a fairer eye,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed</line>
<line remap="LINE">And give him light that it was blinded by.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Study is like the heaven's glorious sun</line>
<line remap="LINE">That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Small have continual plodders ever won</line>
<line remap="LINE">Save base authority from others' books</line>
<line remap="LINE">These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights</line>
<line remap="LINE">That give a name to every fixed star</line>
<line remap="LINE">Have no more profit of their shining nights</line>
<line remap="LINE">Than those that walk and wot not what they are.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Too much to know is to know nought but fame;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And every godfather can give a name.</line>

<line remap="LINE">Consider what you first did swear unto,</line>
<line remap="LINE">To fast, to study, and to see no woman;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And abstinence engenders maladies.</line>
<line remap="LINE">And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,</line>
<line remap="LINE">In that each of you have forsworn his book,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?</line>
<line remap="LINE">For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Have found the ground of study's excellence</line>
<line remap="LINE">Without the beauty of a woman's face?</line>
<para remap="STAGEDIR">From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;
They are the ground, the books, the academes
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire</para>
<line remap="LINE">Why, universal plodding poisons up</line>
<line remap="LINE">The nimble spirits in the arteries,</line>
<line remap="LINE">As motion and long-during action tires</line>

<line remap="LINE">Now, for not looking on a woman's face,</line>
<line remap="LINE">You have in that forsworn the use of eyes</line>
<line remap="LINE">And study too, the causer of your vow;</line>
<line remap="LINE">For where is any author in the world</line>
<line remap="LINE">Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?</line>
<line remap="LINE">Learning is but an adjunct to ourself</line>
<line remap="LINE">And where we are our learning likewise is:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Do we not likewise see our learning there?</line>
<line remap="LINE">O, we have made a vow to study, lords,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And in that vow we have forsworn our books.</line>
<line remap="LINE">For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,</line>
<line remap="LINE">In leaden contemplation have found out</line>
<line remap="LINE">Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes</line>
<line remap="LINE">Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?</line>
<line remap="LINE">Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And therefore, finding barren practisers,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:</line>
<line remap="LINE">But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Lives not alone immured in the brain;</line>
<line remap="LINE">But, with the motion of all elements,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Courses as swift as thought in every power,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And gives to every power a double power,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Above their functions and their offices.</line>
<line remap="LINE">It adds a precious seeing to the eye;</line>
<line remap="LINE">A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;</line>
<line remap="LINE">A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,</line>
<line remap="LINE">When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Love's feeling is more soft and sensible</line>
<line remap="LINE">Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:</line>
<line remap="LINE">For valour, is not Love a Hercules,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?</line>
<line remap="LINE">Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical</line>
<line remap="LINE">As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:</line>
<line remap="LINE">And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods</line>
<line remap="LINE">Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Never durst poet touch a pen to write</line>
<line remap="LINE">Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;</line>
<line remap="LINE">O, then his lines would ravish savage ears</line>
<line remap="LINE">And plant in tyrants mild humility.</line>
<line remap="LINE">From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:</line>

<line remap="LINE">They are the books, the arts, the academes,</line>
<line remap="LINE">That show, contain and nourish all the world:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Else none at all in ought proves excellent.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Then fools you were these women to forswear,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.</line>
<line remap="LINE">For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.</line>
<line remap="LINE">It is religion to be thus forsworn,</line>
