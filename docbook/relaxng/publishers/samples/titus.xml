<line remap="LINE">As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,</line>
<line remap="LINE">No funeral rite, nor man m mourning weeds,</line>
<line remap="LINE">No mournful bell shall ring her burial;</line>
<line remap="LINE">But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And, being so, shall have like want of pity.</line>
<line remap="LINE">See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,</line>
<line remap="LINE">By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Then, afterwards, to order well the state,</line>
<line remap="LINE">That like events may ne'er it ruinate.</line>
