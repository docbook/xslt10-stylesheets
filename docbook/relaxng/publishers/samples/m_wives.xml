<line remap="LINE">Away with Slender and with him at Eton</line>

<line remap="LINE">Her mother, ever strong against that match</line>
<line remap="LINE">And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed</line>
<line remap="LINE">That he shall likewise shuffle her away,</line>
<line remap="LINE">While other sports are tasking of their minds,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And at the deanery, where a priest attends,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot</line>
<line remap="LINE">She seemingly obedient likewise hath</line>
<line remap="LINE">Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Her father means she shall be all in white,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And in that habit, when Slender sees his time</line>
<line remap="LINE">To take her by the hand and bid her go,</line>
<line remap="LINE">She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,</line>
<line remap="LINE">The better to denote her to the doctor,</line>
<line remap="LINE">For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,</line>
<line remap="LINE">That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,</line>
<line remap="LINE">With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,</line>
<line remap="LINE">To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,</line>
<line remap="LINE">The maid hath given consent to go with him.</line>
