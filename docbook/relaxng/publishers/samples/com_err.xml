<line remap="LINE">To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives</line>
<line remap="LINE">Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</line>

<line remap="LINE">'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</line>
<line remap="LINE">It hath in solemn synods been decreed</line>
<line remap="LINE">Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</line>

<speaker remap="SPEAKER">AEGEON</speaker>
<line remap="LINE">A heavier task could not have been imposed</line>
<line remap="LINE">Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Yet, that the world may witness that my end</line>
<line remap="LINE">Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,</line>
<line remap="LINE">I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.</line>
<line remap="LINE">In Syracusa was I born, and wed</line>
<line remap="LINE">Unto a woman, happy but for me,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And by me, had not our hap been bad.</line>
<line remap="LINE">With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased</line>
<line remap="LINE">By prosperous voyages I often made</line>
<line remap="LINE">To Epidamnum; till my factor's death</line>
<line remap="LINE">And the great care of goods at random left</line>
<line remap="LINE">Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:</line>
<line remap="LINE">From whom my absence was not six months old</line>
<line remap="LINE">Before herself, almost at fainting under</line>
<line remap="LINE">The pleasing punishment that women bear,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Had made provision for her following me</line>
<line remap="LINE">And soon and safe arrived where I was.</line>
<line remap="LINE">There had she not been long, but she became</line>
<line remap="LINE">A joyful mother of two goodly sons;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And, which was strange, the one so like the other,</line>
<line remap="LINE">As could not be distinguish'd but by names.</line>
<line remap="LINE">That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</line>
<line remap="LINE">A meaner woman was delivered</line>
<line remap="LINE">Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--</line>
<line remap="LINE">I bought and brought up to attend my sons.</line>
<line remap="LINE">My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Made daily motions for our home return:</line>
<line remap="LINE">Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,</line>
<line remap="LINE">We came aboard.</line>
<line remap="LINE">A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Before the always wind-obeying deep</line>
<line remap="LINE">Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</line>
<line remap="LINE">But longer did we not retain much hope;</line>
<line remap="LINE">For what obscured light the heavens did grant</line>
<line remap="LINE">Did but convey unto our fearful minds</line>
<line remap="LINE">A doubtful warrant of immediate death;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Which though myself would gladly have embraced,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Weeping before for what she saw must come,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</line>
<line remap="LINE">That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Forced me to seek delays for them and me.</line>
<line remap="LINE">And this it was, for other means was none:</line>
<line remap="LINE">The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</line>
<line remap="LINE">And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:</line>
<line remap="LINE">My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Such as seafaring men provide for storms;</line>
<line remap="LINE">To him one of the other twins was bound,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:</line>
<line remap="LINE">The children thus disposed, my wife and I,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</line>
<line remap="LINE">At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Dispersed those vapours that offended us;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And by the benefit of his wished light,</line>
<line remap="LINE">The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered</line>
<line remap="LINE">Two ships from far making amain to us,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:</line>
<line remap="LINE">But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!</line>
<line remap="LINE">Gather the sequel by that went before.</line>

<line remap="LINE">O, had the gods done so, I had not now</line>
<line remap="LINE">Worthily term'd them merciless to us!</line>
<line remap="LINE">For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</line>
<line remap="LINE">We were encounterd by a mighty rock;</line>
<line remap="LINE">Which being violently borne upon,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</line>
<line remap="LINE">So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Fortune had left to both of us alike</line>
<line remap="LINE">What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened</line>
<line remap="LINE">With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Was carried with more speed before the wind;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And in our sight they three were taken up</line>
<line remap="LINE">By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</line>
<line remap="LINE">At length, another ship had seized on us;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</line>
<line remap="LINE">Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</line>
<line remap="LINE">And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</line>
<line remap="LINE">Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;</line>
<line remap="LINE">That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,</line>
<line remap="LINE">To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</line>
