            <para>For more than a decade, DocBook has provided a structured markup vocabulary for
                hardware and software documentation. DocBook is now widely used in both commercial
                and Open Source environments. DocBook has a very broad element set, and applies to
                much more than just technical documentation. The DocBook TC is engaged in evolving
                the suite of DocBook specifications. The community benefits from having a standard,
                open, interchangeable vocabulary in which to write structured content. DocBook has
                been, and will continue to be, designed to satisfy this requirement.</para>
            <para>The OASIS DocBook SubCommittee for Publishers is chartered to develop and maintain
                official variants of DocBook in support of the publishing industry. Specifically,
                the subcommittee will focus on schema and stylesheet customizations to support:
                periodicals as regularly published technical notes or journals, book publishing
                (such as business, legal, medical, and other non-technical domains), educational
                textbooks and other document types as appropriate for this industry.</para>
            <para>The DocBook Publishers Schema is based on DocBook 5.0, and delivered in the

        <para>For more than a decade, DocBook has provided a structured markup vocabulary for

            interchangeable vocabulary in which to write structured content. DocBook has been, and
            will continue to be, designed to satisfy this requirement.</para>
        <para>The OASIS DocBook SubCommittee for Publishers is chartered to develop and maintain
            official variants of DocBook in support of the publishing industry. Specifically, the
            subcommittee will focus on schema and stylesheet customizations to support: periodicals
            as regularly published technical notes or journals, book publishing (such as business,
            legal, medical, and other non-technical domains), educational textbooks and other

        <para>The <link xlink:href="mailto:docbook-publishers@lists.oasis-open.org">DocBook
                Publishers subcommittee</link> maintains the DocBook Publishers schema. Based on
            DocBook V5.0, the DocBook Publishers schema is normatively available as a <xref
                linkend="relaxng"/> Schema (with some additional Schematron assertions).</para>
        <para>The DocBook Technical Committee welcomes bug reports and requests for enhancement
            (RFEs) from the user community. The current list of outstanding requests is available
            through the <link xlink:href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</link>

                >tracker</link> interface. This is also the preferred mechanism for submitting new
            requests.</para>
        <para>Of the 361 total elements in the full DocBook standard, the Publishers schema has been
            simplified to exclude 149 elements from full DocBook. Modifications have been made to 11
            patterns from the DocBook schema. Additions to the schema include: the Dublin Core
            metadata elements (54) and 6 new elements.</para>

        <para>This subcommittee will submit additional enhancements back to the full DocBook

            The DocBook Publishers schema has been written as a native RELAX NG grammar, based on
            DocBook V5.0. This effort delivers on the following goals:</para>

        <para>The DocBook Publishers schema includes the following elements above and beyond those
            currently provided by the core DocBook standard. These are considered "official

            <title>Explicit support for Dublin Core metadata</title>
            <para>While DocBook already includes many of the elements that are defined by the Dublin
                Core, it is not inherently interoperable with DC metadata. The Publisher's SC has
                decided to formally adopt Dublin Core metadata (issued 2008-01-14) as a formal
                metadata model for info elements. The Publishers schema will continue to support the
                base DocBook info metadata, but will allow Dublin Core elements as an alternative
                for capturing metadata in this widely adopted schema. In <tag>info</tag>, authors
                will be allowed to use <emphasis>either</emphasis> the standard DocBook elements
                    <emphasis>or</emphasis> Dublin Core elements, and <tag>info</tag> may not
                contain a mix of the two element sets.</para>
            <para>As the Dublin Core standard does not provide a RelaxNG or RelaxNG Compact version
                of their schema, the Publishers SC has endeavored to create Dublin Core in RNC
                format. The Publishers SC plans to contribute the dcterms.rnc, and dcmitypes.rnc
                back to the Dublin Core standard.</para>
            <para>The following Dublin Core elements from the <uri type="namespace"
                    >http://purl.org/dc/terms/</uri> namespace have been defined and included in the
                Publishers schema:</para>

                            Temporal topic may be a named period, date, or date range. A

            <para>In the interest of providing a schema that meets the needs of the Publishing
                industry, the following considerations were made with regard to the modular approach
                to the schema and the exclusion of certain core DocBook elements:</para>

                        <para>The vast majority of Publishers will not need the technical elements
                            from core DocBook. For those titles that require technical markup, the
                            inlines can easily be added as a module to the Publishers schema.</para>

                Publishers schema:</para>
            <note>
                <para>Because the Publishers schema is written in RelaxNG Compact syntax, it is very
                    easy to add elements back into a customization of the Publishers schema. For
                    example, if the elements in the programming module were needed, it is very
                    simple to use an include statement for the programming.rnc file from the source
                    DocBook distribution.</para>
