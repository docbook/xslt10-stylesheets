# This file is part of DocBook NG: The "Absinthe" Release.

# This schema is a "work-in-progress". It validates a DocBook-like grammar that
# may, in some incarnation, form the basis for DocBook V.next. Or it may not.
# At the moment, it's just an exploration by Norm. It has utterly no normative
# value at all.
