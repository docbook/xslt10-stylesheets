	Reworked QAndASet.  DefaultLabel loses the Label value.  Label

	that a Label, if present, is always used (which you can override
	with your stylesheet, if required).

	DefaultMark/Mark become DefaultLabel/Label on QandASet/Question/Answer

	* dbpool.mod:
	Added InformalFigure to informal.class, where it had accidentally
	been left out.

	* dbpool.mod:
	Changed the 'label' value of DefaultMark on QandASet to 'mark'
	since the attribute is 'mark'.

	* dbpool.mod: Revised QandASet. QandAEntry now recurses in Answer, not
	QandAEntry. Question and Answer no longer have a Title,
	they have a Mark attribute. Renamed Mark attribute on
	QandASet to DefaultMark.
