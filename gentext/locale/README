README for DocBook locale files

This README explains how to create, change, and
contribute locale files for use with DocBook.

-------------------------------------------------------
CREATING OR CHANGING A LOCALE FILE
-------------------------------------------------------
If you want to contribute a locale file for a language
that is not in the current distribution, copy the
en.xml file from here:

  https://github.com/docbook/xslt10-stylesheets/tree/master/gentext/locale/en.xml

If you want to make changes to an existing locale file,
copy the appropriate locale file from:

  https://github.com/docbook/xslt10-stylesheets/tree/master/gentext/locale/

The main parts of the file that you need to translate are:

  - The 'text' attribute of <gentext> and <dingbat>
    elements.

  - The "datetime-full" and "datetime-abbrev" parts
    (translators often overlook those because they are
    near the end of the file)

You may also want to translate parts of he element
content of the <template> elements. In particular:

  <template name="page">(page %p)</template>
  <template name="docname"> in %o</template>
  <template name="docnamelong"> in the document titled %o</template>
  <template name="pageabbrev">(p. %p)</template>
  <template name="Page">Page %p</template>

NOTE: You don't have to translate empty elements such
as '<Chapter/>' that are used in the <template> element
content. For example, you can just leave the <Chapter/>
part of the following unchanged.

  <template name="chapter"><Chapter/>&#160;%n.&#160;%t</template>

You'd only want to change the "&#160;%n.&#160;%t" if
needed for your locale.

-------------------------------------------------------
ABOUT THE <letters> PART
-------------------------------------------------------
The content in the <letters> part of the file is used
for building of sorted indexes.

You can find more information in this article:

  http://www.kosek.cz/xml/2004xmlconf/

And the easiest way to understand it is probably to examine
the <letters> part of the Czech locale file:

  https://github.com/docbook/xslt10-stylesheets/tree/master/gentext/locale/cs.xml

Basically:

  - for each letter used in the alphabet for your
    locale, include a <l i="n">X</l> instance; (i.e.,
    if your locale has a 46-letter alphabet, include
    <l> element for each letter)

  - the value of "i" attribute is a number that
    indicates the sorting order for that letter. For
    letters that should be grouped together, just use
    the same value for the "i" attribute.

NOTE: You do not need to translate the <letters> part
of the file UNLESS, in your locale:

  - words with initial accented letters are typically
    sorted into different index divisions than words
    with unaccented initial letters.

  OR 

  - words starting with certain combinations of
    two-letter initial characters are are sorted
    differently/separately (e.g., in Spanish indexes,
    words starting with "ch" are sorted differently
    than other words starting with "c").

If you need more help with understanding the <letters>
part, post a request to docbook-apps@lists.oasis-open.org.

-------------------------------------------------------
ABOUT ENCODINGS
-------------------------------------------------------
Encode your locale file into UTF-8 (or convert it to
UTF-8 before submitting it).  Use "real" Unicode
characters is possible; if not, use numerical character
references (hexadecimal or decimal). Do not use named
character entities.

-------------------------------------------------------
SUBMITTING A NEW OR CHANGED LOCALE FILE
-------------------------------------------------------
After you have finished creating or changing a locale
file, please submit the updated file (or a diff) to 
either the "Issues" or "Pull request" tracker available via

  https://github.com/docbook/xslt10-stylesheets/

That's all you need to know in order to create, change,
and submit locale files.

You can ask questions at the docbook-apps mailing list:

  docbook-apps@lists.oasis-open.org

-------------------------------------------------------
                BACKGROUND INFORMATION
-------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of these files is to provide localizations
of certain text used in output from the DocBook
stylesheets. The files are used in building both the
DSSSL and XSL stylesheet distributions.

-------------------------------------------------------
The DTD
-------------------------------------------------------
There is a separate file for each language.  
They are written in XML, using the DTD in
docbook/gentext/dtd/l10n.dtd.  However, each file
does not have a DOCTYPE declaration because each
is a SYSTEM entity that is pulled into the master
file at runtime.  The master file in XSL is
docbook/xsl/common/l10n.xml.  Also, the files
will not validate against the DTD because they
also contain elements in the "doc:" namespace
that are not in the DTD.

-------------------------------------------------------
The elements
-------------------------------------------------------

<gentext>
  General strings and labels that need translation
  are in <gentext> elements. The 'key' attribute is
  how each element is referenced by the stylesheet,
  and the 'text' attribute contains the actual
  text to insert.  There are also some <dingbat>
  elements for special characters.

<context>
  The <context> elements are wrappers around a group of
  <template> elements that apply in that context.
  The stylesheet determines when a given context name is
  used.

<template>
  In a <template> element, the 'name' attribute identifies
  the element to which the template applies, and the content
  of the <template> element is the generated string.
  Within the element's content, any empty elements such
  as '<Chapter/>' are replaced with the 'text' from the
  <gentext> element whose 'key' attribute matches the
  element name.  That enables items translated in <gentext>
  to be used in the <template> elements. That way many of the
  <template> elements do not require direct translation.

  Also, %t, %s, and %n in the template content are
  placeholders for an element's title, subtitle, or label
  number, respectively.  These are replaced at runtime for
  the document instance.

<letters>
  The content in the <letters> part of the file is used
  for building of sorted indexes.

NOTE: The DSSSL stylesheets use only the <gentext>
      elements, not the <context> or <template> or
      <letters> elements.

-------------------------------------------------------
The build process
-------------------------------------------------------
When an XSL stylesheet distribution is created, each source
locale file is processed with docbook/gentext/xsl/xsl.xsl
stylesheet to produce the distributed version.
The stylesheet replaces elements such as '<Chapter/>'
with the corresponding text, and fills in missing items
with English versions.

The DSSSL distribution uses the dsssl.xsl stylesheet instead.
It does not backfill missing entries with English.

-------------------------------------------------------
Comparing a locale file to the en.xml file
-------------------------------------------------------
The locale files should all contain the same number of
entries, but unfortunately they are not all kept up to
date and so they may differ somewhat.  The included Perl
script Auditlocale.pl can be used to compare a given
locale file with the English file en.xml, which is the
most complete file.  Usage:

  perl Auditlocale.pl  fr.xml  >  report.fr

In the report, the various sections of the
locale file are indicated with lines like:

  =================================== gentext

These are followed by any differences in that section.

You can also look in the corresponding locale file in
the distribution.  During the build, any items that were
missing from the source file are filled in with English
versions in the distribution, and marked with a lang="en"
attribute so it is obvious.  That ensures that all
locale files in the distribution have the same set of
entries, even if not all of them are translated.
