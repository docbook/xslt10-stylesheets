-------------------------------------------------------------------
 Compatibility
-------------------------------------------------------------------
`docbook-menu-mode' has been tested and found to work reliably with
both the GNU/Linux (Debian) and Microsoft Windows versions of GNU
Emacs 21.3, 21.2, and 20.7, as well as Meadow version 20.7. It
probably will not work at all with XEmacs or with earlier versions of
GNU Emacs (e.g., Emacs 19.x).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
 Commentary
------------------------------------------------------------------
This package adds a hierarchical, customizable menu for quickly
accessing a variety of DocBook-related documentation and for easily
getting to files in the DocBook XSLT stylesheets distribution.

See the Installation and Configuration, and Customization sections
below for "getting started" how-to instructions.

The menu this package provides is intended as a sort of "at your
fingertips" ready-reference for people who use Emacs to edit
DocBook XML files and/or work with the DocBook XSLT stylesheets
(creating customization layers to change parameters and templates).

There are some screenshots of it at:

 Installation and Configuration
-------------------------------------------------------------------

To install and use this package:

1. Go to the docbook-menu download site:

     http://www.logopoeia.com/docbook/downloadwww.logopoeia.com/docbook/download

   And download the latest docbook-menu-N.NN.zip file
   (for example, docbook-menu-1.00.zip).

2. Move the docbook-menu-N.NN.zip file into the folder/directory
   where you want to install it (e.g., your Emacs "site-lisp"
   directory or your "My Documents" folder or whatever) and then
   unzip it to create a docbook-menu-N.NN directory (for example,
   'docbook-menu-1.00').

3. Add the docbook-menu-N.NN directory to your Emacs load-path.
   You can do that by adding a line similar to the following to
   the beginning of your .emacs file.

     (add-to-list 'load-path "c:/my-xml-stuff/docbook-menu-1.00")

4. Add the following to your .emacs file exactly as shown:

     (require 'dbk-menu)

==================================================================
Note: The *.elc files included in this distribution are byte-compiled
      for Emacs 21.x. So, to use this package with Emacs 20.7 or
      Meadow 20.7, you must remove all *.elc files from the main
      "docbook-menu" directory and its "submenus" subdirectory before
      restarting Emacs. Then re-compile them.
==================================================================

After you restart Emacs, to view the menu at any time, either:

  - choose Show DocBook Menu from the Emacs Help menu
      or
  - type "\M-x docbook-menu-mode<return>" (on MS Windows, that's
    "Alt-x docbook-menu-mode" and then hit <Enter>)

Note: To make the DocBook: The Definitive Guide (HTML Help) and
      DocBook XSL submenus work correctly, you must set values for
      some options.  See the Customization section below for details.

Showing the menu automatically
------------------------------
There are a couple of ways you can make the menu automatically
show up (rather than needing to invoke it manually)

  - To show the menu by default, after you open a new file, so that
    it shows up no matter what buffer/mode you're in, add the
    following to your .emacs file:

      (add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'docbook-menu-mode)

  - To show the menu only when you're in a certain major mode (for
    example, only in nxml-mode)

      (add-hook 'nxml-mode-hook 'docbook-menu-mode)

To be able to show/hide the menu using a shorter keyboard shortcut,
you need to add something like the following to your .emacs file.

  (define-key global-map "\C-cd" 'docbook-menu-mode)

That example will enable you to use the 'Ctrl-c d' keyboard to
show/hide the menu.

For more details, see documentation within the docbk-menu.el file.
