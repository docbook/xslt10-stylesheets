<para>This small, somewhat contrived website demonstrates the
Website document type. Website provides a system for building static
Websites from XML content.</para>

<note>
  <para>Though this "site" remains a good example of a Website
  instance, the how-to information here is no longer actively
  maintained. For more up-to-date information, see the <ulink
  url="http://sagehill.net/docbookxsl/Website.html">Website</ulink>
  chapter in Bob Stayton's book <ulink

  Complete Guide</ulink>.</para>
</note>

<para>Both <ulink url="index.html">tabular</ulink> and <ulink
url="n-index.html">non-tabular</ulink> versions are available,
demonstrating how multiple presentations can be derived from the same
sources.</para>

<section><title>What is a Website?</title>

<para>A website is a collection of pages organized, for the purposes of
navigation, into one or more hierarchies. In Website, each page is a
separate XML document authored according to the Website schema/DTD, a customization
of <ulink url="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/">DocBook</ulink>.</para>

<para>Website imposes the following additional constraints:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Each <sgmltag>webpage</sgmltag> must have an ID and
the IDs must be unique across the entire website.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>No page can occur in more than one location in the
navigational hierarchy of the website. Note, however, that you can have
pages, such as the <olink targetdocent="about.xml">about page</olink>,
that don't appear in the navigational hierarchy at all.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<section><title>Requirements</title>

<para>In order to build a website with DocBook Website, you must have,
at a minimum:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>The Website DTD (either
<filename>website.dtd</filename> or
<filename>website-full.dtd</filename>) OR the Website RELAX NG schema
(<filename>website.rnc</filename> or
<filename>website-full.rnc</filename>).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The <ulink
url="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.4/">DocBook XML
V4.4</ulink> DTD (if you want to use
<filename>website-full.dtd</filename>).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The Website XSL stylesheets.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The <ulink
url="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/">DocBook XSL
Stylesheets</ulink> (which are imported by the Website XSL
stylesheets).</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>An XSLT engine such as Saxon or xsltproc.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<section><title>Changes from Website 1.x</title>

<para>I've completely redesigned the way the Website doctype works for
V2. In version 1, all of the pages in a website were part of a single,
monolithic XML document.</para>

<para>Making all of the pages part of a single document had a number
of drawbacks:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>It wasn't convenient to update only part of a website
(only the pages that had been changed, for example).
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>For very large websites, there were memory issues associated
with parsing and formatting the whole thing.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>There was no practical way to publish the XML content of
a site.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>It was difficult to share pages across different web sites.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>It was very tedious to setup a system that allowed
the same content to be published
with different navigational hierarchies.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>Website overcomes all of these difficulties.</para>

<para>In fairness, the old style had some advantages:</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>There was only a single source document to maintain.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Navigation was derived automatically from the structure
of the source document.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Link checking was cheap and easy.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
