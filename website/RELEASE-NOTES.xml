  <para>These are the release notes for the DocBook Website
  distribution. This file provides a high-level overview of features
  and API changes in each release.</para>

  <para>Bug fixes are (mostly) not documented here. For a complete

  descriptions for changes in the project CVS repository.</para>

    <title>Release 2.6.0</title>
    <para>This release includes some significant schema changes, as
    well as a few relatively minor changes to the Website XSL
    stylesheets, and a handful of bug fixes. It also includes a new
    (and still experimental) <filename>install.sh</filename> script to
    facilitate XML catalog and locating-rules setup.

	<para>Website (non-full) is now based on <ulink
	url="http://docbook.org/xml/simple/1.1/index.html" >Simplified
	DocBook 1.1</ulink> and Website "full" is now based on <ulink
	url="http://docbook.org/xml/4.4/index.html" >DocBook
	4.4</ulink>. The main benefit this provides is the ability to
	use HTML tables in your Website XML source (instead of just
	CALS tables).</para>

      <listitem>
	<para>RELAX NG schemas in RNC (compact-syntax) form as well as
	in RNG (XML syntax) form are now included in the
	distribution. You can use those to do context-sensitive
	Website editing in a RELAX NG-aware editor such as Emacs/nXML,
	oXygen XML Editor, XMLBuddy, or Exchanger XML Editor. (Note
	that the RELAX NG schemas are currently generated from the
	DTDs).</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>A <filename>locatingrules.xml</filename> file has been
	added to the distribution. The
	<filename>locatingrules.xml</filename> file tells a "locating
	rules"-aware editor such as Emacs/nXML to automatically
	associate the included RELAX NG Website schema with any
	document whose root element is <sgmltag>webpage</sgmltag>.</para>
